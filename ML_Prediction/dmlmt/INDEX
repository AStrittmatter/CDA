CV_core                 This function contains the core parts of the CV
                        for Lasso and Post-Lasso
OLS_pred_w              This function calculates the OLS weights for
                        the fitted values of each observation
PO_dmlmt                This function calculates the potential outcomes
                        for all treatment levels.
PO_dmlmt_w              This function calculates the weights impled by
                        Double Machine learning.
PO_dmlmt_w_gen          This function calculates the weights impled by
                        Double Machine learning if outcome weights are
                        already calculated.
TE_dmlmt                This function calculates the average treatment
                        effects for all combinations. Requires input
                        from 'PO_dmlmt'.
add_intercept           Adds an intercept to a matrix
dmlmt                   Double machine learning for binary and multiple
                        treatments'
find_Xse_ind            Function finds the position for pre-specified
                        SE rules
fitted_values           This function extracts a subset of active
                        variables (nm_act) of the relavant variables
                        from X'X and X'y to get out-of-sample
                        predictions for a matrix containing only the
                        active variables This speeds up the
                        cross-validation for post-Lasso to a large
                        extent
gps_cs                  This function checks common support for a user
                        provided matrix of (generalized) propensity
                        scores
gps_prep                This function prepares the (generalized)
                        propensity scores and checks the common support
                        after variable selection.
norm_w_to_n             Function to normalize weights to N or to N in
                        treated and controls separately
post_lasso_cv           This function uses the 'glmnet' package to
                        estimate the coefficient paths and
                        cross-validates Lasso AND Post-Lasso
y_prep                  This function prepares the fitted values of the
                        outcome after variable selection.
